# Shelf-intelligence
The following project was generall to create computer vision  model that woould detect commodities in a supermarket and count them.
I used the roboflow site to make my customised dataset more meaningful,that is ensure the oictures are of the right size aas required before modelling.
The data was acquired by taking random pictures in the shelves of supermarket.
The data and modelling is entirely dode in the aws plaform where train and test data is stored in the S3 buckets and the modelling done using aws rekognition.
